CoCoBoot2


CoCoBoot2 allows a profiled bootup of a Color Computer 2 or 3. Some of the important goals of CoCoBoot2:

The replacement of Nitros9's BOOT and REL modules.
Dynamic loading of Nitros9 modules directly from any RBF filesystem.
Dynamic loading of HDBDOS.



REQUIREMENTS

DECB or HDBDOS *
Color Extended Basic

* RGB DOS seems to work but testing remains.

At the very least, you will need a way to access a floppy image from
your coco.  CoCoBoot (CCB) uses the DSKCON interface, so any system
supporting DSKCON will be able to boot CCB.  This includes most
flavors of ROM for the CoCo.

I have plans in the future to support Cassette Tape and direct ROM
based loading.



STARTING COCOBOOT

CoCoBoot is distributed as a DDSS floppy image of a CoCo's normal 35
track, 18 sector disk.  This image presents a valid RSDOS filesystem
to DECB ( or HDBDOS ) and includes a "AUTOEXEC.BAS" file, HDBDOS
Volume Label, and a "DOS" track.  This allows for easy autobooting of
CCB from newer emulators like XRoar or anything running HDBDOS.  

to Manualy start CCB, insert the CCB disk into Drive 0, and type the
following at the BASIC prompt:

DOS

or

LOAD"AUTOEXEC.BAS":RUN


Obviously, the prefered choice is the "DOS" command, but under just
DECB, CCB will be restricted to only loading CCB off drive 0.  Users with a
ROM'ed HDBDOS will also be able to type:

DOS #

where "#" is the drive number storing the CoCoBoot disk.
 


CONFIGURING COCOBOOT

On first boot, CCB boots directly to a setup program allowing one to
configure CCB.  It is recommended to be familiar with your machines'
settings, in particular your HDB OFFSETs and ROM slot/bank contents. I
would advise making a list, before you setup CCB of:

* MPI switch settings for drive devices
IDE/SCSI/CoCoSDC hardware address settings
SuperIDE/CoCoSDC flash ROM contents
Nitros9 devices, drives, and offsets ( if using SuperDriver )
HDBDOS devices, drives, and offsets 
Which flavor of DriveWire are you using? (bitbanger?, becker? )

NOTE:  Under the Main Menu of the CCB setup program, is a HDBDOS
examiner, which will let you scan your ROM's for DECB and report
a HDBDOS's ROM settings.

WARNING: You can do bad things with CoCoBoot. *very bad things*. The
one, however, that's not entire horrible, is incorectly modifying
HDBDOS's partition offset.  That's the long-ish hex number that
specifies were on a particular drive the HDBDOS floppy images start.
Attempting to write to a drive in HDBDOS with an improperly set Offset
is disasterous. Reading, however is ugly, if not benign.



The setup (SETUP) program is a simple menu program designed for configuring
the boot process.  The menu system is simple and fast.  All menu
items are selected via a keystroke.  The inverted charactor is the key
needed to select this item.  Text/Number fields require a "CR", or
pressing <ENTER> to accept and continue after selection (and
editing).  Pretty much a 1980's style menu interface.  Pressing
<BREAK> will navaigate up the menusystem.  <RIGHT_ARROW> and
<LEFT_ARROW> are used in "selector" fields, such as the HDBDOS image
selectors.  And finaly some rotation selections simple rotate through
a list of regular settings at each selection.  

NOTE:  All of CoCoBoot's numbers are in *HEX* not decimal!


The MAIN Menu:

System Type
   Select either CoCo2 or CoCo3

Timeout 
   Enter number of second to wait at bootup for user to press a
   key to enter the boot menu.  After this timeout the default profile
   is loaded and booted.

No Autoboot 
   Set to disable timeout booting.  If this is set to "yes"
   then CCB will not attempt to autoboot, and will alway present a
   boot menu at bootup.

Default Profile 
   Select to rotate through which profile to autoboot, if
   enabled, above.

Profile 0-4
   Pressing 0-4 will activate the profile-setup submenu for the
   respective profile. See "BOOT PROFILES" below.

Write Config
   Will write the configuration file to disk.  You will be prompted
   for assurance, press "Y" or "N".

Load Config
   Will load the configuration tables from disk. You will be prompted
   for assurance, press "Y" or "N".

Reboot
   does the obvious really well.

HDB Exam
   Selecting this will load a sub-program to allow you to peruse your
   external ROMS for settings.



BOOT PROFILES

CoCoBoot allows the user to create 4 distinct boot profiles that can
be user selected or autoloaded at boot.  SETUP allows for the
configuration of each profile via a sub-menu.  There are four primary
boot methods, "DOS", "HDB", "ROM", "OS9".  Each method has its own
particular settings that can be modified. (NOTE: not all of the
boot methods will present these settings!)

Tag
  A Texual Name that presented at bootup for this profile. Select to
  edit and press <ENTER> to accept and set after editing.

Disk Rom Image
  Allows user to choose which flavor of HDBDOS to load.  Selecting
  this will present the user with a large selector widget to select
  which flavor of HDB.  The "OS9" boot method will use this to select
  which HDB driver to load.  Use arrow keys to select and <BREAK> to
  go back to the profile editor.

MPI Switch
  CCB will swich the MPI switch upon boot to the current setting.

Device Address
  - The HDB boot method uses this to patch HDBDOS prior to reboot.
  - The ROM boot method uses this as the hardware base of the flash rom
  of SuperIDE or CoCoSDC.

Flash Rom Bank
  controls which flash rom to activate (Super IDE or CoCoSDC )

HDB OFFSET
  The starting sector of the HDB floppies.

DEFID
  The HDBDOS default ID.  This is used by HDBDOS to select the default
  drive number for SCSI, IDE and DW

Disable Autoboot
  Patches the loaded HDB to NOT autoboot "AUTOEXEC.BAS"

Drive No
  - OS9 boot method uses this to set which drive to boot Nitros from
  - DOS boot method uses this switch DSKCON disk prior to boot
  


BOOT METHODS

"External ROM" or "ROM":  simply activates an external flash ROM or
regular ROM and boots it.  

"OS9" is a new style Nitros9 booter that directly loads OS9BOOT from
the RBF disk located in any HDBDOS supported device/drive.  A special
module, called CCBKrn, is loaded as a replacement for regular
Krn. 

"DOS" replicates the action of a BASIC "DOS" command.  Great for
old-school loading of OS9 ( or CoCoBoot ) located on any particular
HDBDOS device/disk/partition.  It loads the selected device/drive's
boot track to $2600 and boots it.

"HDB LOADER" loads up one of the 17 flavors of HDBDOS and sets it up
with the given device/drive/offsets.  Very convenient for boot
DriveWire.
