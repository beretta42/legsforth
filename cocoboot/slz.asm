;;; This is a slz compression module
;;; slz is a very simple windowing compression format based off lz77.

	;; this function uncompresses slz data
	;; takes X - address to decode image to
	;; takes Y - address of compressed image
	;; clobbers everything

;; Notes on the above from William Astle (lost@l-w.ca) about my changes
;;
;; the puls d,pc bit works because the tag counter and the tag byte stack
;; variable are present on the stack; puls d,pc removes both of those to
;; a and b respectively (clobbers them) and then does the expected rts
;;
;; the use of U as the temporary pointer when doing the dictionary
;; decode avoids spilling another register to the stack but it does
;; clobber U in addition to X and Y
;;
;; the original negation for D was coma, comb, addd #1 which, while correct
;; is one byte longer and a couple cycles slower than nega, negb, sbca #0
;;
;; by moving the length calculation below the offset calculation, the need
;; for a temporary to save the length is removed. The stack usage for A
;; in this case was also present prior to modification
;;
;; by using the stack as a temporary to save the current tag byte, 2 bytes
;; are used to set up the stack space and two bytes are used to access it
;; with no additional bytes being needed to clean it up as it combines into
;; the already present puls instruction. However, depending on the assembler
;; and linker, the bss variable previously used might have been accessed
;; using a 16 bit address which gives us a net neutral result but eliminates
;; the need for a bss variable making the routine completely self contained.
;;
;; It is possible to save two more bytes in this routine if (and only if)
;; it can be assumed that DP points somewhere useful that will not clobber
;; anything and there is a free byte somewhere at that location. Assuming
;; DECB is present, one can use 0xFF in the direct page which turns into
;; 0x00FF for a real memory address. In that case, one can remove the
;; leas -1,s and replace both ",s" accesses with "<$FF" (or whatever
;; prefix is needed for direct page access). Then replace the final
;; "puls d,pc" with "puls a,pc".
;;
;; As it stands, this routine assembles to 59 bytes. With the direct page
;; trick above, it can assemble to 57 bytes.
