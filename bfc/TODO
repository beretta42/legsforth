* make negative hex numbers work
* factor out >num
* parse command line args
* command line defined memory store size
* control stack checking
* memory store address bounds checking
* make target dictionary
* print warning for redefining host immediate word
* print linkage statitics
* deal with different CELL widths (16/24/32....)
* create host immediate word to make new primitives
* create a flexible system for defining different dictionary formats
* support devirtualized memory - will speed up simple machines (like cocos)
